Say hi to your friends through Bonjour by creating (empty) Remote Shares in
their Finder.

Install
-------

1. Install Go by [downloading a package](https://golang.org/dl/) or on OS X with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) like `brew install go` (or for the beta, `brew install --devel go`). You might have to open a new shell to get the env variables you need.
1. Get bonjourno: `go get github.com/subparlabs/bonjourno`
1. Try running `bonjourno`. If it didn't find it, you probably don't have `$GOPATH/bin` in your path, so just run it from there: `$GOPATH/bin/bonjourno`

Run with `--help` for usage. If you have problems, open an [Issue](https://github.com/SubparLabs/bonjourno/issues).
